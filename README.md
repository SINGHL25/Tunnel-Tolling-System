📚 Knowledge Base

10 detailed information modules covering:

Lane Control Signs (LCS)
Speed Limit Signs (VSLS)
Variable Message Signs (VMS)
Over-Height Detection
Dangerous Goods Detection
Hot Spot Detection
Emergency Telephones
Public Address System
License Plate Recognition
Fire Safety Protocols




📊 Real-Time Statistics

Vehicles in tunnel counter
Total transactions
Average speed calculation

🎮 Interactive Controls

Add vehicles (various types)
Emergency closure button
Fire alarm activation
System reset function
Auto-generated traffic simulation



Assumptions Made:

Toll Pricing:

Standard vehicles: $5
Dangerous goods: $12 (premium for hazardous materials)
Over-height vehicles: $15 (special clearance required)


Detection Intervals:

Emergency phones: Every 150-200m (as per regulations)
Lane control signs: Every 200-400m
Speed signs: Every 400m


Traffic Flow:

3-lane tunnel configuration
Maximum tunnel length: ~800m simulation distance
Speed limits: 60-90 km/h range
Auto-generation of traffic every 3 seconds when operational


Emergency Protocols:

Immediate tunnel closure on emergency
Traffic light coordination
Alert system activation
All systems halt during emergency mode


Camera Coverage:

4 strategic camera positions
Continuous monitoring capability
Visual confirmation for all detection systems

Runbook for Client Acceptance:

Initial System Check

Verify all panels load correctly
Confirm system status shows "OPERATIONAL"
Check all sensor indicators show green (active)


Basic Functionality Test

Click "Add Vehicle" - verify vehicle appears and moves
Watch vehicle exit - confirm toll transaction logged
Check statistics update (vehicle count, transactions, revenue)


Detection Systems Test

Add "Hot Vehicle" - verify alert triggers
Add "Dangerous Goods" - confirm warning displays
Add "Over-Height" - validate detection indicator


Emergency Protocols Test

Click "EMERGENCY CLOSURE" - lights turn red, tunnel closes
Click "FIRE ALARM" - alert dialog appears
Click "Reset System" - normal operations resume


Knowledge Base Test

Click any KB item - modal opens with detailed info
Close modal - returns to main view


Auto-Simulation Test

Wait 10 seconds - vehicles auto-generate
Observe mixed traffic types
Monitor continuous operation



Sign-Off Criteria:
✅ All subsystems operational
✅ No console errors
✅ Animations perform smoothly
✅ Emergency controls respond immediately
✅ Data persistence during session
✅ Knowledge base accessible
✅ Transaction logging accurate
✅ Revenue calculation correct
